# Web Scraping Quotes Project

This project demonstrates how to scrape quotes from a website using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Requests libraries.

## Project Overview

The script collects quotes from a target website and extracts relevant information such as:

- Quote text
- Author of the quote
- Additional tags associated with each quote (if available)

## Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the script.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing the HTML content and navigating the structure of the webpage.
- **Requests**: Allows sending HTTP requests to the target website to retrieve its content.

## Project Structure

```
├── quotes_scraper.py    # The main Python script for scraping
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nareshreddy624262?tab=repositories
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quotes-scraper
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python quotes_scraper.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will output the following details for each quote:

- **Quote**: The actual text of the quote.
- **Author**: The person who said the quote.
- **Tags**: Keywords associated with the quote.

Example:

```text
"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." - Oscar Wilde
Tags: [inspirational, self-confidence, life]
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add functionality to scrape additional information (e.g., categories, likes).
- Store the scraped data in a database or export to a CSV file.
